		<div>Tracker Usage:</div>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Make sure the tracker is configured exactly how you want it before
				beginning. Changing some settings after marking off items may not update
				certain parts of the tracker correctly.
			</li>
			<li>
				Left clicking on any object toggles whether or not they are collected.
			</li>
			<li>
				Left clicking on a key or upgrade (boots/hammer) increments the counter,
				right clicking will decrement the counter.
			</li>
			<li>
				Star Spirits will highlight when all the requirements to acquire them
				glitchlessly are met.
			</li>
			<li>
				Right clicking on a Star Spirit will increment a number from 1-7, that
				can be useful for tracking chapter difficulty with the "shuffle
				chapters" option in seeds.
			</li>
			<li>
				Right clicking on various "optional" items will add a checkmark to them,
				this can be used to signify that they have been turned in.
			</li>
			<li>
				Settings are expected to be configured before items are marked. Some
				items or completion states may not update when changing settings.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<ul>
			<li>
				This site uses localstorage to remember your previously used settings!
				Some browsers or plugins may disable this when you disable cookies as
				well. This won't break anything, but you will have to manually re-enter
				your settings each time.
			</li>
			<li>
				If something looks weird, try force refreshing the page (Shift+F5 in
				Windows browsers for example).
			</li>
